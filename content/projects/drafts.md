A respository of public-facing writing and notes (*a la* the personal websites of old). This repository contains notes on books, papers, and other stuff. It is filled with half-baked ideas about science, math, programming, and stuff that I think is fun.

This website is not a blog. Do not expect to find polished writing or coherent thoughts here. It is also unsuitable for academic, professional, or commercial use.
