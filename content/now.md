A list of the things I'm focused on or involved - *now*. Expect me to use this as an excuse regularly. Inspired by the [/now page by Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).

## Undergraduate Studies
I'm currently studying biochemistry and (hopefully) mathematics. I'm mostly focused on this. Taking classes on chemistry, linear algebra, and Spanish.

## Research
I've been working in the [Coyle Lab](https://coylelab.org) since June 2022, doing research on cool reaction-diffusion systems and cell organization. This research kickstarted my interested in biochemistry and computational modeling.

I spend about as much time as I can in the lab right now. I am losing my mind with these yeast, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.

## Reading
I took a literature class this past year, realized I'm largely unfamiliar with the Western canon, and decided to remedy that. Lots of books to read and probably not enough time, but I'm making an effort. There's a lot of really good books out there and not enough time. The other thing I'm learning to do is put down books that I don't enjoy.

## Music
I play the contrabass as a hobby, but I've been practicing a lot more lately for some auditions. Currently focusing on the Dragonetti Concerto. Also practicing excerpts from Dvorak and Tchaikovsky.

## Biking
Okay, not as much of this as I would really like. But I've been getting out of the house more and biking on trails with friends, which has been a lot of fun.

## Learning Web Development
I've made and remade this website by hand, with jekyll, with gatsby, with chisel, and with hugo. After fiddling around with it for a few weeks, I think I want to stick with hugo - it really is awesome for development.

This is the seventh(?) iteration of this website that I've built. I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm slowly realizing just how much I don't know what I'm doing. Still, stack exchange is a blessing and I have a decent understanding of logical operators. It's only a matter of time.
