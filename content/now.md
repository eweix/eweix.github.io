A list of the things I'm focused on or involved - *now*. Expect me to use this as an excuse regularly. Inspired by the [/now page by Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).

## Undergraduate Studies
I'm currently studying biochemistry, with a side of math.
Mostly focused on this right now, since school is important and fun.
Taking classes on chemistry, linear algebra, and Spanish.
Realizing that proofs are fun but trying.

## Research
I've been working in the [Coyle Lab](https://coylelab.org) since June 2022, doing research on cool [reaction-diffusion systems](https://jasonwebb.github.io/reaction-diffusion-playground/) and cell organization.
Lab work sparked my interests in biochemistry and modeling.

I spend about as much time as I can in the lab right now.
I am losing my mind with these yeast, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.

## Reading
I took a literature class this past year, realized I'm largely unfamiliar with the Western canon, and decided to remedy that.
Lots of books to read and probably not enough time, but I'm making an effort.
I'm also reading a lot of other books for fun ~~and profit~~, though my diet is still heavily sci-fi and fantasy novels.

I'm learning to put down books that I don't enjoy.
There's too many good things to read and never enough time.
This is difficult for me to do, just as its difficult for me to stop eating if there's food in front of me.

[I keep a list of what I've read](https://eweix.github.io/drafts/books/). Still working on putting together an [antilibrary](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary). Not much room for it, unfortunately, and I tend to rely more on public libraries than private bookshelves.

## Music
I play the contrabass for fun.
I'm still working on the [Dragonetti Concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABDReZi-2Wg), which is a joy to play and listen to. I find myself humming it almost every minute of the day.

## Biking
Okay, not as much of this as I would really like.
But I've been getting out of the house more and biking on trails with friends, which has been a lot of fun.

## Learning Web Development
I've made and remade this website by hand, with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), with [chisel.py](https://github.com/dz/chisel), and finally with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
After fiddling around with it for a few weeks, I think I want to stick with hugo - it really is awesome for development.

This is the seventh(?) iteration of this website that I've built.
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm slowly realizing just how much I don't know what I'm doing.
Still, stack exchange is a blessing and I have a decent understanding of logical operators.
It's only a matter of time.
